Explain and Reflect:
Explain the differences between Java and JavaScript + node. Topics you could include:
that Java is a compiled language and JavaScript a scripted language
 Java is both a language and a platform
General differences in language features.
Blocking vs. non-blocking
Explain generally about node.js, when it “makes sense” and npm, and how it “fits” into the node echo system.
Explain about the Event Loop in JavaScript, including terms like; blocking, non-blocking, event loop, callback queue and "other" API's. Make sure to include why this is relevant for us as developers.
What does it mean if a method in nodes API's ends with xxxxxxSync?
      Explain the terms JavaScript Engine (name at least one) and JavaScript Runtime Environment (name at least two)
Explain (some) of the purposes with the tools Babel and WebPack and how they differ from each other.       Use examples from the exercises.
Explain using sufficient code examples the following features in JavaScript (and node)
Variable/function-Hoisting
this in JavaScript and how it differs from what we know from Java/.net.
Function Closures and the JavaScript Module Pattern
User-defined Callback Functions (writing functions that take a callback)
Explain the methods map, filter and reduce
Provide examples of user-defined reusable modules implemented in Node.js (learnynode - 6)
Provide examples and explain the es2015 features: let, arrow functions, this, rest parameters, destructuring objects and arrays,   maps/sets etc.
       Provide an example of ES6 inheritance and reflect over the differences between Inheritance in Java and in ES6.
Explain and demonstrate, how to implement event-based code, how to emit events and how to listen for such events
ES6,7,8,ES-next and TypeScript
Provide examples with es-next, running in a browser, using Babel and Webpack
Explain the two strategies for improving JavaScript: Babel and ES6 + ES-Next, versus Typescript. What does it require to use these technologies: In our backend with Node and in (many different) Browsers
Provide examples to demonstrate the benefits of using TypeScript, including, types, interfaces, classes and generics
Explain how we can get typescript code completion for external imports.
      Explain the ECMAScript Proposal Process for how new features are added to the language (the TC39 Process)
